Hyper Island - The First App Module - Brief 1

### üìÇ The Brief:
Using the swedish radio API to build a feature which is build with JavaScript. It should be readable and maintainable. 

### ‚è≥ Time spent / Deadline:
4 days.

### üéØ Goals:
<ul>
<li>Using an API</li>
<li>Creating the project foundation with JavaScript for the next step (refactoring the project with react)</li>
</ul>

### ü¶æ The working process:
 The first step was to get to know the swedish radio API. 
 The idea about an app for all the childrens programs came to me and I worked towards this goal by dividing the tasks in managable steps.
 The design was not the goal in this brief and therefore did I reuse earlier sass-code.   
 We met in the support group for check-ins each day to help each other out.

### :headphones: The projects content
I created a webbpage where all the programs for children are. You can switch between programes for 3-8 year olds or programs for 9-13 year olds. 
If you click on a program, all available episodes are shown (or at least so many as the browser allows).
You then can play the episode you want and pause if you need a break.
